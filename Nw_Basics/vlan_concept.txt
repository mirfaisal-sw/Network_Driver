VLAN: -
--------
--  Using VLAN, different small-size sub-networks are created which are comparatively easy to handle. 
--  Virtual LAN (VLAN) is a concept in which we can divide the devices logically on layer 2 (data link layer)
    using a switch.
--  Generally, layer 3 devices divide the broadcast domain but swithces can also divide the broadcast domain 
    using the concept of VLAN. 
	A broadcast domain is a network segment in which if a device broadcast a packet then all the devices in the
	same broadcast domain will receive it. The devices in the same broadcast domain will receive all the broadcast
	packets but it is limited to switches only as routers donâ€™t forward out the broadcast packet.
	To forward out the packets to different VLAN (from one VLAN to another) or broadcast domains, inter Vlan routing
	is needed.
