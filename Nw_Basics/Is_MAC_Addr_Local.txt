Is my MAC address public when browsing the Internet?
-------------------------------------------------------

The MAC-address is part of the Link-Layer in the OSI Network Model. It's only used for communication in 
our local network, be it cabled or wireless.
The computers MAC definitely gets lost when it passes through router, the router only transmits the IP 
packet to "the Internet". When connecting to the internet our router will not use our computers, but its
own MAC address to forward the packet.
