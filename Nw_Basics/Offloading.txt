Offloading: - 
==============
Most modern operating systems support some form of network offloading, where some network processing happens on the NIC instead of the CPU.
Normally this is a great thing. It can free up resources on the rest of the system and let it handle more connections. 

Checksum Offload
-----------------
On systems that support checksum offloading, IP, TCP, and UDP checksums are calculated on the NIC just before they're transmitted on the wire.
In Wireshark these show up as outgoing packets marked black with red Text and the note [incorrect, should be xxxx (maybe caused by "TCP checksum offload"?)].

Linux
--------
Checksum offloading can be enabled and disabled with the ethtool command.
To check:
	ethtool --show-offload  ethX

To disable:
	ethtool --offload  ethX  rx off  tx off
