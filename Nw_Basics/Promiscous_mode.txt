Promiscous mode in Networking: -
===================================
In an Ethernet local area network (LAN), promiscuous mode
ensures that every data packet that is transmitted is received
and read by a network adapter. This means the adapter does not
filter packets. Instead, it passes each packet on to the operating
system (OS) or any monitoring application installed on the network.

Packet sniffers uses Promiscous mode. This enables the interface or adapter to 
pass all network traffic up the stack, regardless of the packets' destination
addresses.
