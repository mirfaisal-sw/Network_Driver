==============

RTNL => Routing Netlink

In the Linux kernel, rtnl_lock refers to a lock used to protect the routing and networking subsystem's data
structures from concurrent access. It ensures that operations on these structures, such as modifying routing
tables, interfaces, or any network-related configurations, are thread-safe.

The lock is part of the Routing Netlink (RTNL) subsystem, which is a communication interface between the kernel
and user space for network-related configurations. When a process wants to change the networking state (like
adding or deleting a route or interface), it must acquire this lock to prevent race conditions or inconsistent
states caused by simultaneous modifications from different contexts.

Typically, developers will use rtnl_lock() to acquire the lock before performing changes and rtnl_unlock() to
release it afterward. This locking mechanism helps maintain the integrity of the networking state in a multi-
threaded environment.
