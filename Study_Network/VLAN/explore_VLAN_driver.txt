Path of VLAN code in Linux kernel: -
-------------------------------------

	<kernel_src>/net/8021q



VLAN filtering
-------------------
The following two components are used in the Linux kernel for dealing with 802.1Q VLAN tags:

I. The 8021q module (activated by CONFIG_VLAN_8021Q) for creating VLAN subinterfaces of network
   devices with tagged traffic.
   
II. The CONFIG_BRIDGE_VLAN_FILTERING support for implementing 802.1d bridging (port membership
    enforcements).
